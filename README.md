- This is a simple to-do-list project that I created using Python
- This project is a collection of the knowledge I learned during the past year in college. So, I'm pretty proud of it haha.
- Some features: add, delete, update and show
- The question is: How to use it?
- Make sure that you have Python 3.6 or newer version.
- Download this folder and run "main.py" file.
